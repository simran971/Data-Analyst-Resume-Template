# Resume-Template-Data-Analyst-Profile
I have created a single-page, two-column resume for Data Analyst. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The main sections in the resume are Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, Certifications and Awards with relevant courses mentioned for Data Analyst Role.

# Objective
Almost all the resume building websites are paid , and requires subscriptions, so I created this template. Most currently available templates either focus on two columns, or are multiple pages long. I personally found the multiple pages long templates hard to focus and multiple-page resumes were just too long to be used in career fairs.

Below is a brief preview or glimpse.
